<p>This project began as a proof of concept for building data-driven web applications to support our aviation clients. Airlines are beginning to make better operational and strategic investment decisions based on the data that's driving their business. Key to unlocking the value of data is the ability to visualize, interact with, and interrogate this information in meaningful ways. We wanted to explore innovative, rapid application development solutions that provide valuable decision support tools to help the aviation industry grow.
We developed this application primarily in AngularJS, driven by node.js on the backend and a mongodb database. Looking for a hands on test drive? Let's get in touch.</p>
