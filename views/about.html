                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Applied by Design was founded on the idea that engineering web applications succeed when technical design requirements, user experience and overall project strategy are developed in concert and are continuously synchronized. With a passion for good design, solving hard problems and working with a wide set of customers, we set out to see if we could do some good.</p>
               <!--      <p>Engineering first.  We started in engineering, and continue to persist a mentality of integrity, discipline, and system level thinking in all that we do.  We believe this is critical to the success of modern day products and customer solutions.  We have experienced first hand what happens when this is ignored or under appreciated: talk about it here?</p> -->
