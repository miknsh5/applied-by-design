        <p>The hardest part is also the most important part, and it happens before the engineers even get their hands dirty. We guide our clients through the formal exercises of better understanding their customers, using that understanding to scope and define their project’s life and setting up the process for continual tracking and course correction.</p>

        <h1 class="services">Design</h1>
        <p>The most sophisticated analytical tools fail if user experience, user interface and data visualization are not understood and prioritized. Smart design principles begin with requirements communication and end with the final product. We love good design and we introduce our clients to concepts, tools and solutions to make their projects work.</p>
